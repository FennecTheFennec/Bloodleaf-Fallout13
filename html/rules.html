Bloodleaf - Basic Rules

Disclaimer: These rules, while enforced, may be subject to change at any time for any reason. Just because it’s not in the rules doesn’t mean you can’t get in trouble for it, use your brain and common sense to know what’s right and wrong or ask an admin for clarification!
Rule #1: General
-Participating in roleplay is encouraged, as we are a role playing server. The amount of RP may vary situation-to-situation, but should remain a constant element.

-Disregarding RP entirely is generally unacceptable. Wordlessly and emotelessly getting into a fight is an example of disregarding RP. The NCR, Legion and Brotherhood have stricter regulations on this, as listed below.

-Not every fight is equal in stakes or circumstances. You don’t have to write a paragraph about how you slide across the cafeteria to start a fistfight. In a conflict situation, a quick, short emote about pulling out your gun and firing works just fine, or you may instead elect to use the aim function without any triggers and yell to get down. These are just examples, and if you are uncertain, feel free to ahelp.

-Don’t be a Dick. If you are intentionally ruining another players experience or going out of your way to negatively impact the round, you can be punished for it. This rule is also enforced on Discord.

- Harassing players in LOOC, OOC, Discord or private messages is prohibited.

- Raider activities, like stealing and enslaving, are not breaking this rule. Though, you should still try to maintain atmosphere while doing it, and should attempt to make it fun or interesting for both parties. Give the other side a story to remember.

- Raiding unguarded bases as any faction falls under this rule.

- To raid a faction base, ahelp first. Upon arriving at the target location you must have escalating RP with the garrison before any combat. 

- If there are no admins on, put extra effort into escalation for base raids and send someone prior to warn them that you'll be arriving to attack at some point. When admins are on this step isn't necassary.

- Using Me as a way to bypass an IC or OOC inability to use say is prohibited. The only exception is if you know and successfully roleplay using ASL.
- Do not attack, assault or harm SSD/AFK players. You may take their equipment, but dragging them off or murdering them is not okay. Catatonic Players are free game.
Rule #2: Character Backstory/Naming

-Your character's backstory should make sense within the lore of Fallout. End of story. We're in the US. Not Communist China pre-war.

Character naming should always be taken seriously, as this is an RP server, and you should attempt to follow the below when it comes to naming.

●       NO: Naming a character based off something else (e.g. Peter Griffin, Michelle Obama, Gordon Freeman, ect.)

●       NO: Naming a character that sounds vaguely similar or is in reference to another character (e.g. Tonald Drump, Griffin Peter, Freedon Gorman, ect.)

●       NO: Wild colored hair if you're anything but a wastelander or raider. Factions such as the BoS, NCR, and Legion shouldn't look like a bunch of street signs.


●       DO: Have a surname, regardless of faction. This is in line with the rule of 'naming schemes' just prior to this.


You have plenty of leeway for your characters creation-wise. Just use common sense.
Rule #3: Stay in Character

-  IC in IC. OOC in OOC.

IC stands for “In Character”, while OOC stands for “Out of Character”.

-Being in character is vital to roleplay and game experience. Do not use emoticons and text talk (e.g. “I c u”, “wtf man”, “how r u c:”).

-Do not bring anything that is IC related into OOC chat, such as telling everyone in OOC that you are dead, if there is an issue always ahelp rather than immediately jumping to OOC.
 
-Being out of character should only happen in the appropriate OOC channels on discord and when using LOOC/OOC in game, this also means that you should never bring anything OOC related into IC, such as your dislike of another player so you avoid healing them when they come through medical, or giving them a more harsh sentence  in security. Conversely, bringing IC hate into OOC/LOOC rants is frowned upon and likely to have you muted.
Rule #4: Erotic Role Play
- ERP (Erotic Role Play) is strictly against the rules and should be reported immediately. Any ERP will result in an immediate perma-ban without appeal.
Rule #5: Metagaming

-Communication taking place to share IC information regarding an ongoing round OOCly is a big no. This includes, but isn’t limited to:

●       DMs/Voice Chat regarding ongoing in round happenings.

●       Posting about the ongoing round OOCly.
Rule #6: Roleplay / Escalation

- As we are an MRP-HRP server, you're fully expected to maintain immersion and avoid acting out of character. Spouting memes and other LRP comments etc ICly can result in admins immediately banning you obviously seeing your not the kind of player that is desired on the Bloodleaf server.

- Escalation requires a motive, as well as verbal interaction to establish hostile intent. Similar to warning you're going to attack them.

- Escalation requires a reaction from the party being escalated on. This reaction can be drawing their own weapon, running away, popping pre-combat meds and so forth.

- Pointing does not count for escalation.

- If someone is attempting to negotiate or is complying with your demands, you should not assault them for trying to negotiate, but instead interact with them. If their case is bad, you may still kill them after denying them.

- If someone uses the SURRENDER emote, it's courteous to not harm them unless they subsequently attempt to flee or attack you. That being said, it's not necessarily expected of you in the slightest. (Further down the line, you are free to do with them as you wish.)

- If you are caught in the crossfire of a fight, that is not an excuse to join either side's conflict. You should get out of the way. Emphasis on act accordingly and just duck into cover so you don’t get shot!

- You may still enter into conflict with non-faction groups, but should escalate clearly and openly, and wait at least 5 seconds before attempting any hostile actions. Make sure you're wearing an armor or by one of the factions to obviously appear as one of them. You still need IC reason to join them.

- Escalation through radio is only valid when participants have agreed/replied to it.
Examples of Escalation:
Aggressor is a raider: (Motivation: Raiding and stealing, etc) and tells the victim to get on the ground. Victim draws their own gun. Situation is fully escalated and combat may ensue.

Aggressor is a raider: (Motivation: Raiding and stealing, etc) and tells the victim to get on the ground. Victim replies “Please don’t hurt me” and lays on the ground. The raider now has full control over the victim and may do whatever they please with them, including killing them if they state their intent first.

Aggressor is NCR: (Motivation: To deal with a raider gang.) and tells them to surrender or die. Some of the Raiders Surrender, but the rest are gunned down. The NCR then detains the raiders that surrendered.

 - - -

 - Further, disguises for anything other than reconnaissance are strictly forbidden. You may not suddenly strip a disguise to shoot into the back of 'friendlies', nor may you engage in active combat while disguised. This goes for all factions, not just the NCR and Legion. Acceptions may be applied in the case of admin events.
Rule #7: Factions and Regulations

- Caesar’s Legion’ Rules:

Chain of Command

- Caesar

- Legate

- Praetorian

- Centurion

- Decanus

- Explorer

- Veteran Legionary

- Legionary

- Followers/Auxilus

- Slave

While Vexillarius don't hold a true rank in the ladder, they're still held to a higher standard than the average recruit or warrior in the Legion. They rarely see combat and are more for boosting morale.

- All combat personnel must have a Roman/Latin styled name and must be male.

- The Legion heavily frowns upon the use of any chems produced outside of natural means. This is mostly an IC rule, but if it gets out of hand then it'll become an OOC one. Any legionnaire seen using chems should be considered too weak to be a legionnaire. Powder and poultices only. No stims no med-x.

- The Legion eschews advanced technology, but will opportunistically use weapons where they can. This does not include cyborgs or power armor. Energy weapons should be a last resort.

- Legion does not tolerate other Legionnaires using chems and other drugs, and should enforce them to their standards.

- The Legion has standards for prisoners, and should not further abuse prisoners that are of a condition to be valuable slaves.

- New California Republic Rules:

NCR Chain of Command
- General

- Colonel

- Major

- Captain

- Lieutenant

- Staff Sergeant

- Sergeant

- Corporal / Specialist

- Trooper

- Recruit

- Breaking the Chain of Command or deserting means you can be summarily executed by commanding officers.


- No drinking, gambling, or sleeping on Duty. The CO determines who is Off-Duty, traditionally when any major threats in the area are dealt with.


- No Drugs, excluding Med-X for those in great pain. You can be imprisoned and possibly executed for using recreational chems.


- Sergeants (In special cases a corporal) control the Armory, unless a superior officer takes control. You should not go into it and grab whatever equipment you like. 


- The NCR has laws around human rights, and they are expected to treat their prisoners humanely. Problematic prisoners can be executed on the order of the commanding officer, but compliant prisoners should not be harmed.
 - - -
- Brotherhood Rules:

BoS Chain of Command
- Elder
- Sentinel

- Head Scribe / Paladin

- Paladin / Scribe / Knight

- Initiates

- Directly ignoring the orders of the Elder or a superior may put you at risk of being outcast or executed. This is up to the Elder.

- Maintain the secrecy of the bunker at all times, and don't betray your chapter without a very good reason.

- You shouldn't associate with the NCR or Legion unless absolutely necessary. After all, you're technically at war with the prior, and the latter are filthy tribals.

- Knights maintain the bunker and armory. Scribes are in charge of Research and Development, alongside Medical. Paladins are the be-all-end-all when it comes to bunker Security.

- The codex and Chain that Binds may be disregarded by the Elder, and, by extension, the Chapter. This only applies if the Elder chooses such.

- - -

Cyborgs and robots are held to a higher degree and violations result in direct jobban or tempban.

- Know and follow your laws by the letter.

No excuses given, you are given abnormal powers, trust and access, to break your laws is to eat a ban. 

- Cyborgs are bound to their direct or indirect creator.

If they lack a creator they are meaningless and are allowed to roam the waste but not take part in it.

   - In each situation, an admins ruling is how the rules are to be treated in that given situation.

- Borgs are stuck to their law set unconditionally but follow any command structure that the laws apply to.

- Borgs are players too, bound by the same laws of escalation. There are no exceptions. 

     - If you give a Borg a law that implies or states to attack on sight, you will be punished.
Rule #8: Meta Grudging

Meta Grudging is the act of using meta knowledge to hinder, interfere, or overall ruin another player's experience because of past rounds or things that have happened in OOC. Seeing a character you've never met be shot, dying and calling out for help within your own faction, but refusing treatment just because you know the player is meta grudge.

Understand that there is a difference between meta grudge and not liking another character. Two characters who have interacted with each other numerous times may have some kind of bad-blood, causing the two to act hostile, cold, or even scoff at one's presence with an occasional insult. This is character development, and unless it hinders or ruins your game, it's not meta. Always ask an admin for clarification if you feel you are a victim of such.
Rule #9: Admins have the final say
- Rule lawyering and finding loopholes won't be tolerated, the rules will be enforced as intended.
Discord / Other:

●       Material:

Don’t post content that could lead to Discord shutting down the Server. This is anything that may violate their terms of service, or otherwise.

Just use basic morals and you’ll be golden.

●       Brigading:

Do not try to raid or harass other servers, we don't want to get wiped by Discord.

●       Slurs:

Slurs in game that make sense to lore are permitted (citation needed), while LRP ones are not.

Discord/OOC slurs are generally fine as long as you are not creating genuine misery towards someone, and that is not being spammed.

Seriously, just try to be a decent human being.
